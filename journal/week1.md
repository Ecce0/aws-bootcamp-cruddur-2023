 #### Docker
 Dockerhub - provided by Docker - is a container registry. You can host your own container images for private or host and share. 
 There are other container registries. I.e. AWS ECS, Kubernetes?, J-frog. Its free.99. You can also use in VS Code, due to laptop ready to crash, use gitpod.io
   1 - Create a file called 'Dockerfile'
   2 - Within the file, you put the Docker config, each line expresses to the env path how to run the app:
        
        FROM python:3.10-slim-buster - this loads another dockerfile on dockerhub, python is the language, 3 is the version

        WORKDIR /backend-flask - the container will start running from the backend-flask ON THE GUEST OS (the container), its an entry point
         *the host operating system is what you're on (in my case, its windows), the guest os is the container

        COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt - this copies "requirements.txt" from the host OS (outside container) and places "requirements.txt" inside the guest OS
                                                 it contains the libraries we want to install
                                                 
        RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt - this will install the python libraries on the guest OS (inside container)

        COPY . . - the first period means "everything" inside the host OS and the 2nd period means everything in the guest OS 

        ENV FLASK_ENV=development - its just a regular env var; this is where you would set all your env vars and they're set on the guest OS

        EXPOSE ${PORT} - expose the port the app is running on 
        
        CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"] - within the brackets are commands to run for flask


   Be sure to unlock the key-lock to make the url public

   docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask - this commands actually builds the container. You should get a successful message afterwards.
    docker - docker
    build - builds the image
    -t - tags a name
    backend-flask creates the tag name "backend-flask"
    ./backend-flask - looks in the current directory to look for the Dockerfile

   HOST OS - the computer in your house running on an operating system (an Apple Mac running on MacOS system)
   GUEST OS - has to do with virtualization; 
   HYPERVISOR - allows you to virtualize a computer onto a computer
   With Containers, A CONTAINER DAEMON replaces the hypervisor and shares technologies witht he HOST OS and the container
